# Frontrunning attack in Vault contract

#### 1. Description
The `Vault` contract is vulnerable to front-running attacks due to the following issues:

1. Slippage Vulnerability in `convertToShares` and `convertToAssets`:
   - The functions `convertToShares` and `convertToAssets` calculate conversion rates using real-time ratios (`totalAssets` and `totalShares`) without implementing slippage protection.
   - These ratios are derived from the latest checkpoint (`_checkpoints[_accounts[address(0)].read().latest]`) and can be influenced by external factors, such as deposits or redemptions.
   - An attacker can monitor pending transactions and manipulate the checkpoint timing to alter the conversion rate temporarily, leading to unfavorable slippage for the victim.

2. No Commit-Reveal Mechanism:
   - Actions like deposits, redemptions, and updates are executed in a single transaction without a commit-reveal scheme.
   - This makes sensitive operations vulnerable to sandwich attacks, where an attacker:
     1. Front-runs the user's transaction to manipulate the state (e.g., increase asset prices).
     2. Executes their own transaction to profit from the manipulated state.
     3. Back-runs the user's transaction to restore the original state.

#### 2. Proof of Concept
1. Slippage Manipulation:
   - Alice submits a transaction to deposit assets into the vault.
   - Bob, a malicious actor, detects Alice's pending transaction in the mempool.
   - Bob front-runs Alice's transaction by submitting a large deposit, which shifts the `totalAssets` and `totalShares` ratio.
   - Alice's transaction executes at an unfavorable rate due to the altered ratio.
   - Bob back-runs Alice's transaction by withdrawing his deposit, restoring the original state while profiting from the temporary manipulation.

2. Sandwich Attack:
   - Alice submits a transaction to redeem shares from the vault.
   - Bob detects Alice's pending transaction and front-runs it by redeeming a large number of shares, causing the `totalAssets` to decrease.
   - Alice's transaction executes at a lower asset-per-share ratio, resulting in fewer assets received.
   - Bob back-runs Alice's transaction by re-depositing his redeemed assets, restoring the original state while profiting from the price difference.

```Soldity
function convertToShares(UFixed6 assets) external view returns (UFixed6) {
        (UFixed6 _totalAssets, UFixed6 _totalShares) =
            (UFixed6Lib.unsafeFrom(totalAssets()), totalShares());
        return _totalShares.isZero() ? assets : assets.muldiv(_totalShares, _totalAssets);
}

function convertToAssets(UFixed6 shares) external view returns (UFixed6) {
        (UFixed6 _totalAssets, UFixed6 _totalShares) =
            (UFixed6Lib.unsafeFrom(totalAssets()), totalShares());
        return _totalShares.isZero() ? shares : shares.muldiv(_totalAssets, _totalShares);
}
```

#### 3. Impact
- Financial Loss: Users may experience significant slippage or lose funds due to sandwich attacks.
- Market Integrity: Manipulation of conversion rates undermines the fairness and reliability of the vault's operations.
- Likelihood: High (Front-running is a well-documented and prevalent attack vector in DeFi).
