# Incorrect Single-Sided Position Validation Leading to Potential State Corruption

The [validate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-perennial-v2-4-update/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/core/contracts/libs/InvariantLib.sol#L19-L115) function includes a check to ensure that positions are single-sided (i.e  either entirely maker or taker, but not both). However, the logic is flawed in the following snippet:

```solidity
        if (!updateContext.currentPositionLocal.singleSided()) revert IMarket.MarketNotSingleSidedError();

        if (
            (!context.latestPositionLocal.maker.isZero() && !updateContext.currentPositionLocal.skew().isZero()) ||
            (!context.latestPositionLocal.skew().isZero() && !updateContext.currentPositionLocal.maker.isZero())
        ) revert IMarket.MarketNotSingleSidedError();
```

The issue arises because the second condition redundantly checks the same state as the first condition (`updateContext.currentPositionLocal.singleSided()`). Additionally, the validation does not account for pending positions (`context.pendingLocal`), which could result in a state where the current position appears single-sided, but the pending position introduces a mixed state (both maker and taker). This oversight could allow a position to transition into an invalid mixed state during execution.

### Impact:  
System could allow positions to become mixed (both maker and taker), violating the single-sided invariant. This could lead to incorrect margin calculations, unfair liquidations, or other unintended behaviors that compromise the integrity of the market.

### Mitigation:  
Update the validation logic to include pending positions and ensure the single-sided invariant is enforced holistically.
