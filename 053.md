# `Controller::withdrawWithSignature` may not work due to wrong assumption of 1 DSU = 1 USDC

### Summary

This issue was reported in a previous audit 2024 [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3-judging/issues/35) and also in a previous audit 2023 [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial-judging/issues/22). However, in the collateral `Account` the same issue still exists with assuming 1:1 unwrapping of `DSU` into `USDC` when `reserve.redeem(amount)` is called.

As a consequence, `Controller::withdrawWithSignature()` and `ControllerIncentivized::withdrawWithSignature()` may not work due to this issue.

### Root Cause



In `Account::withdraw()`, `USDC` may be [unwrapped](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-perennial-v2-4-update/blob/2381b47e69b17fe892b1d1d0f467c358cf950143/perennial-v2/packages/periphery/contracts/CollateralAccounts/Account.sol#L81) from `DSU` to facilitate withdrawal by calling `reserve.redeem(amount)` in Account.sol line 103.

However the redeem price may be below 1 in the reserve implementation:

```solidity
function redeemPrice() public view returns (UFixed18) {
    // if overcollateralized, cap at 1:1 redemption / if undercollateralized, redeem pro-rata
    return assets().unsafeDiv(dsu.totalSupply()).min(UFixed18Lib.ONE);
}
```

`Account::withdraw()` then calls `USDC.push(owner, pushAmount)` with `pushAmount` being the `amount`. However since unwrapping `DSU` to `USDC` may not result in 1:1 conversion, this may revert when trying to send more `USDC` to the owner than the contract has.

### Impact

`Controller::withdrawWithSignature()` and `ControllerIncentivized::withdrawWithSignature()` may not work due to this issue.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adjusting `Account::withdraw()` to transfer the difference between balance before and balance after, similar as in MultiInvoker.sol line 398:

```solidity
// Account::withdraw()
83    UFixed6 pushAmount = amount.eq(UFixed6Lib.MAX) ? USDC.balanceOf() : USDC.balanceOf().sub(usdcBalance);
```
