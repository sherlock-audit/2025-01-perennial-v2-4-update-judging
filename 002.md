# Division by Zero in Asset-to-Share and Share-to-Asset Conversion Functions Causes Complete Vault Operation Freeze and Fund Lock

### **Root Cause**  
The issue stems from missing validation checks in the [_toSharesExact()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-perennial-v2-4-update/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/vault/contracts/types/Checkpoint.sol#L236-L238) and [_toAssetsExact()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-perennial-v2-4-update/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/vault/contracts/types/Checkpoint.sol#L232-L234) functions within `CheckpointLib`. These functions rely on the `self.assets` and `self.shares` variables to perform calculations involving division. Specifically:

- In `_toSharesExact()`:
  ```solidity
  return assets.muldiv(self.shares, UFixed6Lib.unsafeFrom(self.assets));
  ```
  Here, the division `assets.muldiv(self.shares, UFixed6Lib.unsafeFrom(self.assets))` does not check if `self.assets` is zero. If `self.assets == 0`, the division operation causes a revert due to division by zero.

- Similarly, in `_toAssetsExact()`:
  ```solidity
  return shares.muldiv(UFixed6Lib.unsafeFrom(self.assets), self.shares);
  ```
  This function assumes that both `self.assets` and `self.shares` are non-zero. If `self.shares == 0`, the division will revert due to a division by zero error.

- **`self.assets` Can Be Zero**:
  - This occurs when the vault has no assets remaining. This may happen due to high withdrawal fees, mismanagement of vault funds, or external market conditions reducing the collateral.

- **`self.shares` Can Be Zero**:
  - This happens when the vault is fresh (no shares minted yet) or has been completely redeemed by all users, resulting in `self.shares == 0`.
The lack of a guard clause (e.g. `require(self.assets > 0)` or `require(self.shares > 0)`) means:
1. These division-by-zero scenarios are not handled gracefully.
2. Any function calling `_toSharesExact()` or `_toAssetsExact()` will revert, halting execution and preventing user interactions with the vault. 
This issue is critical because it directly blocks user operations, essentially locking funds in the vault.

---

### **Internal Pre-conditions**  
1. `self.assets` must be exactly 0 due to vault insolvency or high fees reducing the asset balance to zero.  
2. `self.shares` must be greater than 0, ensuring the division logic is triggered.  

---

### **External Pre-conditions**  
None. This issue arises purely from internal contract state mismanagement.  

---

### **Attack Path**  
1. A user interacts with a function that calls `_toSharesExact()` or `_toAssetsExact()` (e.g., converting assets to shares).  
2. If `self.assets` or `self.shares` is zero, the division operation will revert the transaction.  
3. All users attempting similar operations will face locked funds and inability to execute transactions.

### **Impact**  
[toSharesGlobal()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-perennial-v2-4-update/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/vault/contracts/types/Checkpoint.sol#L155)
```solidity
return self.assets.lte(Fixed6Lib.ZERO) ?
    assets.unsafeSub(settlementFee) :
    _toShares(self, assets).unsafeSub(_toSharesExact(self, settlementFee));
```
If `self.assets == 0`, `_toSharesExact()` will revert. This blocks user deposits from being converted into shares, effectively halting all deposit operations globally.
[toAssetsGlobal()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-perennial-v2-4-update/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/vault/contracts/types/Checkpoint.sol#L164)
If `self.shares == 0`, `_toAssetsExact()` will revert. This blocks users from converting shares back to assets, freezing all redemption operations globally.
```solidity
return (self.shares.isZero() ? shares : _toAssets(self, shares)).unsafeSub(settlementFee);
```
[complete()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-perennial-v2-4-update/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/vault/contracts/types/Checkpoint.sol#L101)
```solidity
self.shares = self.shares.add(profitShares);
...
profitShares = profitAssets.mul(self.shares).div(UFixed6Lib.unsafeFrom(self.assets).sub(profitAssets));
```
If `self.assets == 0`, the profit-sharing calculation in `complete()` will revert. This prevents the checkpoint from finalizing, locking all state updates and stopping vault operations.

---

### **Mitigation**  
Add `require(self.assets > 0, "Assets cannot be zero")` and `require(self.shares > 0, "Shares cannot be zero")` checks before performing division in `_toSharesExact()` and `_toAssetsExact()`.
