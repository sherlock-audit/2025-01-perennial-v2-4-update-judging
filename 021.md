# orders can be executed at incorrect timestamps, leading to mismatched market states and potential financial losses

The bug arises in the [_processOrderGlobal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-perennial-v2-4-update/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/core/contracts/Market.sol#L860-L899) and [_processOrderLocal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-perennial-v2-4-update/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/core/contracts/Market.sol#L905-L946) functions, where the contract fails to correctly handle pending orders whose timestamps fall between the current position's timestamp and the latest oracle version. Specifically, the contract incorrectly advances the order's timestamp to the latest oracle version if `newOrderTimestamp > newOrder.timestamp`, without considering whether the pending order's timestamp is within the valid range for processing. This logic flaw is demonstrated [in the following code snippet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-perennial-v2-4-update/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/core/contracts/Market.sol#L872-L875):

```solidity
if (newOrderTimestamp > newOrder.timestamp) {
    newOrder.next(newOrderTimestamp); // @audit Incorrectly advances the order
    newGuarantee.next();
}
```

For example, if the latest oracle version has a timestamp of `100`, the current position's timestamp is `90`, and a pending order has a timestamp of `95`, the contract will incorrectly advance the order to timestamp `100` instead of processing it at `95`. This results in orders being executed at incorrect timestamps, leading to mismatched market states and potential financial losses.

### **Impact**
Pending orders are processed at the wrong timestamps, causing discrepancies between the expected and actual state of the market. This can lead to financial losses for users due to missed opportunities.

### **Mitigation**
Modify the logic to ensure pending orders are processed at their correct timestamps by checking if `newOrderTimestamp` falls within the valid range between the current position's timestamp and the latest oracle version.
