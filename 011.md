# If `context.global.assets` is zero the `_socialize` function will return `UFixed6Lib.ZERO`, effectively preventing users from claiming any assets

The [_update](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-perennial-v2-4-update/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L313-L351) function allows users to deposit assets, redeem shares, and claim assets. However, there is a critical flaw in the handling of `claimAssets`. Specifically, [the function uses the following logic to determine the claim amount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-perennial-v2-4-update/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L338):

```solidity
UFixed6 claimAmount = _socialize(context, claimAssets);
```

The [_socialize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-perennial-v2-4-update/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L356-L363) function calculates the claim amount based on the proportion of `claimAssets` to the total global assets, but it does not account for the possibility that `context.global.assets` could be zero. If `context.global.assets` is zero, the calculation:

```solidity
return context.global.assets.isZero() ?
            UFixed6Lib.ZERO :
            claimAssets.muldiv(
                UFixed6Lib.unsafeFrom(context.totalCollateral).min(context.global.assets),
                context.global.assets
            );
```

will return `UFixed6Lib.ZERO`, effectively preventing users from claiming any assets, even if there are assets available in the vault.

#### Impact:
 Users may be unable to claim their assets, even if the vault has sufficient collateral.

#### Example Scenario:
- A user attempts to claim assets (`claimAssets`) from the vault.
- Due to a temporary state where `context.global.assets` is zero (e.g. during a rebalance or settlement), the `_socialize` function returns `UFixed6Lib.ZERO`.
- The user receives no assets, even though the vault has sufficient collateral to fulfill the claim.

#### Fix:
the `_socialize` function should handle the case where `context.global.assets` is zero by allowing users to claim their proportional share of the total collateral.
