# Front-Running Vulnerability in executeOrder() of Manager.sol

### Summary

In Manager.sol, inside executeOrder(), the order state (isSpent = true;) is updated after execution, allowing:

**Front-running:** Attackers can monitor the mempool, execute the same order with higher gas fees, and get their transaction mined first.

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A valid pending order exists for a market.
2. An attacker monitors the mempool for executeOrder() calls.
3. The contract does not enforce immediate invalidation (isSpent is set after execution).

### External Pre-conditions

1. Ethereum mempool must be publicly accessible, allowing attackers to see pending executeOrder() transactions.
2. MEV bots or attackers must have faster gas-adjusting strategies to submit transactions with higher gas.

### Attack Path

1. User submits a valid order execution: ```executeOrder(ETHMarket, Alice, 123);```
2. Attacker detects the transaction in the mempool.
3. Attacker submits an identical transaction but with higher gas fees. ```executeOrder(ETHMarket, Alice, 123); // Attacker front-runs this order```
4. The attacker's transaction is mined first, executing Alice’s order under their control.
5. Alice's original transaction gets mined later, failing due to order.isSpent = true;.


### Impact

Users suffer losses due to manipulated execution prices. MEV bots or malicious actors gain unfair advantages over legitimate users. 
Some examples of impact,
1. A stop-loss order is front-run, and the attacker buys at a lower price before it executes.
2. The user’s stop-loss gets triggered at a worse price, and the attacker sells at a profit.
