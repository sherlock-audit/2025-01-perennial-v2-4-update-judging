# Premature Fee Deduction in `next.collateral` Update Leads to Incorrect Collateral Calculations

In the `accumulate()` function of `CheckpointLib`,[the `next.collateral` calculation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-perennial-v2-4-update/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/core/contracts/libs/CheckpointLib.sol#L84-L86) prematurely subtracts settlement and trade fees from the latest checkpointâ€™s collateral before incorporating new collateral changes, price overrides, and other adjustments. Specifically, the code snippet below deducts `tradeFee` and `settlementFee` early in the calculation:

```solidity
next.collateral = settlementContext.latestCheckpoint.collateral
    .sub(settlementContext.latestCheckpoint.tradeFee)
    .sub(Fixed6Lib.from(settlementContext.latestCheckpoint.settlementFee));
```

This approach assumes that all fees are finalized and processed, which may not hold true if there are pending updates or deferred fee calculations in the [toVersion](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-perennial-v2-4-update/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/core/contracts/libs/CheckpointLib.sol#L71). As a result, when the function subsequently adds the new collateral changes and price overrides (`result.collateral` and `result.priceOverride`), it can either double-deduct fees that are recomputed later or produce incorrect final values for `next.collateral`. This discrepancy creates potential inaccuracies in collateral tracking, particularly during edge cases involving concurrent settlement and collateral adjustments.

#### **Impact**:  
The primary impact of this bug is under-collateralization, where the system misrepresents available collateral due to redundant or incomplete fee deductions, which can lead to insolvency or liquidation errors.

#### **Mitigation**:  
Reorder the calculation of `next.collateral` so that settlement and trade fees are subtracted only after adding all new collateral, price override, and other adjustments.
