# Storage Manipulation Attack using `_version` in initialization process

### Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-perennial-v2-4-update/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/core/contracts/Market.sol#L120-L128
```solidity
/// @dev The initialized flag
    Uint256Storage private constant _version = Uint256Storage.wrap(keccak256("equilibria.root.Initializable.version"));

    /// @dev The initializing flag
    BoolStorage private constant _initializing = BoolStorage.wrap(keccak256("equilibria.root.Initializable.initializing"));

    /// @dev Can only be called once per version, `version` is 1-indexed
    modifier initializer(uint256 version) {
        if (version == 0) revert InitializableZeroVersionError();
        if (_version.read() >= version) revert InitializableAlreadyInitializedError(version);

        _version.store(version);
        _initializing.store(true);

        _;

        _initializing.store(false);
        emit Initialized(version);
    }
```
 `_version` is critical to upgrade security.
If it is reset, manipulated, or bypassed, an attacker can take over the contract via re-initialization or forced downgrades.
If `_version` is stored in an upgradeable proxyâ€™s storage, an attacker could overwrite it and re-trigger `initialize()`, bypassing security.
This attack is a serious risk in upgradeable contracts.
Many real-world exploits involve storage overwrites, making `_version` a critical weakness.

### PoC
Since `_version` is used to track the initialization state, if an attacker finds a way to corrupt or reset _version, they can re-trigger initialize().

Attack Steps
Find a Storage Collision or Overwrite `_version`

If `_version` is stored in an upgradeable proxy contract, an attacker could override this slot by deploying a malicious contract that writes over the same storage index.
Example Attack Contract:
```solidity
contract StorageCorruptor {
    function overwriteVersion(address target) public {
        bytes32 slot = keccak256("equilibria.market.version"); // Hypothetical storage slot
        assembly {
            sstore(slot, 0) // Force `_version` back to 0
        }
        IMarket(target).initialize(IMarket.MarketDefinition(...)); // Reinitialize!
    }
}
```
This forces `_version = 0`, bypassing the initializer(1) check.
Call `initialize()` Again

After corrupting `_version`, the attacker calls initialize() again to replace the token and oracle with malicious versions.
Outcome
The attacker resets initialization.
They replace the token with a malicious ERC-20 that allows infinite minting.
They set oracle to a fake price feed, allowing market manipulation.
They drain all user funds by exploiting liquidity rules.

### Recommendation
How to Fix This?
1. Store `_version` in an Immutable Contract
If `_version` is only stored in a proxy contract, it becomes easier to overwrite.
Moving `_version` into an immutable logic contract removes this attack vector.
Double-Lock Initialization with a Boolean Flag

```solidity
bool private _isInitialized;
modifier initializer(uint256 version) {
    require(!_isInitialized, "Already initialized"); 
    _isInitialized = true;
    _;
}
```
This prevents any form of re-initialization.
Use Explicit Storage Slots for Upgradeable Contracts

Instead of keccak256("some string"), explicitly define storage slots to prevent overwrites.
2. Use a Hard Upgrade Lock
```solidity
require(_version == expectedVersion, "Version mismatch!");
```
Blocks reverting to older versions.

3. Verify `_version` Before Upgrading
```solidity
require(proxyAdmin.getVersion() == latestVersion, "Cannot upgrade from old version");
```
