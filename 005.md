# SolverVault Coordinator Will Cause Losses for Vault Users via Unprotected Rebalancing

### Summary

The lack of slippage controls in the rebalance function will cause financial losses for vault users as the coordinator's transactions can be front-run or executed under unfavorable market conditions.

### Root Cause

In [SolverVault.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-perennial-v2-4-update/blob/a77aaa94d3b3a9725e4474428bc0a18ca2fde3b4/perennial-v2/packages/vault/contracts/SolverVault.sol#L40) there is no slippage checks
```solidity
function rebalance(IMarket from, IMarket to, UFixed6 amount) external onlyCoordinator {
        if (!_isRegistered(from) || !_isRegistered(to)) revert SolverVaultNotRegisteredError();
        from.update(address(this), Fixed6Lib.ZERO, Fixed6Lib.from(-1, amount), address(0));
        to.update(address(this), Fixed6Lib.ZERO, Fixed6Lib.from(1, amount), address(0));
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1- Coordinator needs to call rebalance() to move funds between markets.
2- Vault must hold sufficient collateral in the from market.

### External Pre-conditions

1- Market prices for the involved assets must be volatile
2- The rebalance transaction is delayed, allowing market conditions to change unfavorably.

### Attack Path

1- Coordinator calls rebalance(fromMarket, toMarket, 1000 USDC) to adjust positions.

2- Attacker detects the transaction in the mempool and front-runs it by:
Artificially inflating the price of toMarket via a large buy order.
Artificially deflating the price of fromMarket via a large sell order.

3- The coordinator’s rebalance executes at manipulated prices:
Vault sells fromMarket at a lower-than-expected price.
Vault buys toMarket at a higher-than-expected price.

### Impact

Vault users suffer losses proportional to the manipulated price difference during rebalancing. For example:

If the attacker causes a 5% price impact, users lose ~5% of the rebalanced amount.
Attacker gains profit by closing their manipulated positions after the vault’s trade.

### PoC

```solidity
// Simplified Foundry test showcasing front-running
function testFrontrunRebalance() public {
    // 1. Setup: Vault holds 1000 USDC in MarketA
    _depositToVault(1000e6); 
    
    // 2. Attacker manipulates MarketB’s price upward
    vm.startPrank(attacker);
    marketB.trade(attacker, 1_000_000e6); // Inflate price
    vm.stopPrank();

    // 3. Coordinator’s rebalance executes at bad prices
    vm.prank(coordinator);
    solverVault.rebalance(marketA, marketB, 1000e6);

    // 4. Verify loss: Vault’s total assets decrease
    assertLt(solverVault.totalAssets(), 1000e6); 
}
```

### Mitigation

Add slippage controls to the rebalance function :
```solidity
function rebalance(
    IMarket from,
    IMarket to,
    UFixed6 amount,
    UFixed6 minAmountFrom, // Minimum received from `from` market
    UFixed6 minAmountTo,   // Minimum received to `to` market
    uint256 deadline       // Transaction expiry timestamp
) external onlyCoordinator {
    if (block.timestamp > deadline) revert Expired();
    (UFixed6 actualFrom, UFixed6 actualTo) = _executeRebalance(from, to, amount);
    if (actualFrom < minAmountFrom || actualTo < minAmountTo) revert SlippageExceeded();
}
```
