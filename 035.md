# Access violation: Intent counterparty submitter is allowed to be signer instead of operator

### Summary

When user submits Intent, he specifies the `account` which will be the counterparty of the trade:
```solidity
function update(address account, Intent calldata intent, bytes memory signature) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    if (intent.fee.gt(UFixed6Lib.ONE)) revert MarketInvalidIntentFeeError();

    verifier.verifyIntent(intent, signature);

    _updateIntent(
        account,
        msg.sender,
        intent.amount.mul(Fixed6Lib.NEG_ONE),
        intent.price,
        address(0),
        address(0),
        UFixed6Lib.ZERO,
        UFixed6Lib.ZERO,
        false
    ); // account
  ...
```

The issue is that `msg.sender` must be the `operator` of the `account`, because he doesn't sign anything in this function. However, his address is used as signer in `_updateIntent` (which loads update context, filling in signer from the factory, and then later checking the signer flag in `InvariantLib.validate`), thus it's enough for `msg.sender` to be either `signer` or `operator`. If `msg.sender` is only `signer`, he should have no access to this function, but he can execute it and it's enough to be `signer` while not submitting any signature.

The same issue happens with the following `market.update`:
```solidity
    function update(address account, Fixed6 amount, address referrer) external nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
       _updateMarket(account, msg.sender, Fixed6Lib.ZERO, amount, Fixed6Lib.ZERO, referrer);
    }
```
It's enough for `msg.sender` to be signer of account to execute the action, although he doesn't provide any signature, so it must be operator-only.

### Root Cause

`msg.sender` is used as signer argument to `_updateIntent`:

And the same issue here:

### Internal pre-conditions

- User is set as a signer of account, but not as operator

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

- User who only has signer access to account is able to execute `market.update` on behalf of account which is supposed to be only used by the operator.

### Impact

Security access violation: user with incorrect role is able to access function which should be accessed only by the other role.

### Mitigation

Use `address(0)` in `_updateIntent` for `account` signer, and in `_updateMarket` which is not connected with the signature.
