# Users attempting to fully close their positions may find their positions still open due to Incorrect Handling of `MAGIC_VALUE_FULLY_CLOSED_POSITION`

The [_processPositionMagicValue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-perennial-v2-4-update/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/core/contracts/libs/MagicValueLib.sol#L50-L61) function in `MagicValueLib` incorrectly handles the `MAGIC_VALUE_FULLY_CLOSED_POSITION` magic value. When `context.pendingLocal.crossesZero()` returns `true`, the function returns the `currentPosition` without reducing it, even though the intent of `MAGIC_VALUE_FULLY_CLOSED_POSITION` is to fully close the position. This occurs because the function prioritizes the zero-crossing check over the intended action of closing the position. Specifically, the code snippet below shows the flawed logic:

```solidity
if (newPosition.eq(MAGIC_VALUE_FULLY_CLOSED_POSITION)) {
    if (context.pendingLocal.crossesZero()) return currentPosition; // @audit Ignores fully close intent
    return context.pendingLocal.pos().min(currentPosition);
}
```

This logic fails to ensure that the position is fully closed when `crossesZero()` is `true`, this inconsistency can lead to unexpected behavior where the position remains open despite the user's request to close it.
### **Impact**:
Users attempting to fully close their positions may find their positions still open, leading to unintended exposure to market risks or financial losses due to unexpected margin calls or liquidation.

### **Mitigation**:
Ensure that `MAGIC_VALUE_FULLY_CLOSED_POSITION` always results in a fully closed position by returning `UFixed6Lib.ZERO` unconditionally, regardless of `crossesZero()`.
