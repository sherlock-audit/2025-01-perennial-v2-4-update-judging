# Irreversible Order State on Fee Handling Failure

### Summary

looking at the Manager `_raiseKeeper` Fee function, it uses controller. chargeFee to pull fees from the user's account. If chargeFee fails (e.g., insufficient funds), the entire transaction reverts. But the order is already marked as spent, so the user can't retry. This could lock funds permanently, which is a critical problem.

If `_raiseKeeperFee` fails (e.g., due to insufficient user funds), the order is marked as `isSpent = true`, but the fee is not charged. This permanently locks the order, preventing retries.

### Root Cause


**Code Reference**:  
```solidity
function executeOrder(...) external {
    // ... marks order as spent BEFORE fee handling ...
    order.isSpent = true; // ❌ State changed before fee transfer
    _handleKeeperFee(...); // May revert due to insufficient funds
}
```

### Attack Path


**Scenario**:  
1. **User Action**: Alice places an order with `maxFee = 5 DSU`.  
2. **Keeper Execution**: Bob spends gas to execute the order.  
3. **Failure**: Alice’s account has only `3 DSU`, causing `_raiseKeeperFee` to revert.  
4. **Result**: Order is marked `isSpent`, but Alice cannot retry.  




### Impact

- **Funds Locked**: Users cannot retry failed orders, losing access to their collateral.  
- **Denial-of-Service**: Attackers can exploit this to lock legitimate users’ orders.  

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Mark orders as spent **after** successful fee handling.  
- Use a temporary state to track execution progress.
