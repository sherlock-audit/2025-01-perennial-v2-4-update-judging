# Incorrect use of nagative values in `maintained()` and `margined()` function in `Position.sol`

## Summary
The `maintained()` and `margin()` functions wrongly handle negative collateral values making a path for undercollateralized positions to appear solvent.

```
`maintained()` and `margin()` functions
collateral is stored as `Fixed6` which is `signed`  but later converted to `UFIXED6` which is `unsigned` using `UFixed6Lib.unsafeFrom(collateral)`.  
The negative values are wrapped around to large set of numbers due to two representation `-100` â†’ `2^256 - 100` which will cause the check to return true  for negative collateral.

## Impact
Malicious users can maintain positions with negative collaterals bypassing solvency checks.
Malicious actors can also borrow funds without collateralizing.


## Tools Used
Manual review.

## Recommendations
Revert or return false if collateral is negative unless position is empty.
