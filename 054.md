# Inaccurate Keeper Fee in Order Execution

### Summary

The applicableGas is 0, and the KeepConfig has multiplier Base set to 0. This means the fee calculation would be (0 + bufferBase) * gasPrice, which ignores the actual gas used.

Therefore, the _executeOrder function has the issue, where keeper fees aren't accurately calculated based on real gas consumption. This would lead to keepers being underpaid and potentially refusing to execute orders, harming protocol functionality.

### Root Cause

The `_executeOrder` function in the `MultiInvoker` contract miscalculates keeper fees by **hardcoding `applicableGas = 0`**, bypassing actual gas usage tracking. This leads to fees that do not reflect real transaction costs.

### Attack Path

**Scenario**:  
1. User Action: Alice places a trigger order with a `fee = 10 DSU`.  
2. Keeper Exec: Bob calls `_executeOrder`, spending **80,000 gas**.  
3. **Fee Calculation**:  
   - `applicableGas` is **0** (hardcoded).  
   - `fee = (0 + keepBufferBase) * gasPrice = (0 + 10,000) * 20 gwei = 0.0002 ETH` (converted to DSU).  
   - Actual cost: **80,000 gas * 20 gwei = 0.0016 ETH**.  
4. Outcome:  
   - Keeper receives **0.0002 ETH** but spent **0.0016 ETH**.  
   - **Loss**: 0.0014 ETH per transaction. Keepers stop executing orders over time.

**Code Reference**:  
```solidity 
function _executeOrder(...) internal {
    _handleKeeperFee(
        KeepConfig(
            UFixed18Lib.ZERO, // multiplierBase = 0
            keepBufferBase,   // e.g., 10,000 gas
            UFixed18Lib.ZERO,
            keepBufferCalldata
        ),
        0, // ❌ Hardcoded `applicableGas = 0`
        msg.data[0:0],
        0,
        abi.encode(...)
    );
}
```

### Impact

- **Underpaid Keepers**: Fees are based on static buffers (e.g., `keepBufferBase`) instead of real gas usage, causing financial losses for keepers.
- **Protocol Dysfunction**: Persistent underpayment disincentivizes keepers from executing orders, leading to unprocessed orders and user frustration.

### Mitigation

1. **Track Gas Usage**: Measure `gasleft()` before and after order execution.  
2. **Pass Actual Gas**: Use the difference to calculate fees.  

**Fixed Code**:  
```solidity
function _executeOrder(...) internal {
    uint256 startGas = gasleft(); // ✅ Capture initial gas

    // ... execute order logic ...

    uint256 gasUsed = startGas - gasleft(); // ✅ Calculate actual gas
    _handleKeeperFee(
        KeepConfig(...),
        gasUsed, // ✅ Pass real gas usage
        msg.data[0:0],
        0,
        abi.encode(...)
    );
}
```
