# Front-Runnable `maxFee` Reduction

### Summary

Users can reduce the `maxFee` of an existing order, creating a race condition where keepers may execute orders at lower fees than initially promised. 

point is the placeOrder function. It allows updating an order with a lower maxFee, which might let users reduce fees after keepers have already committed gas. This creates a race
condition where keepers might not get paid adequately, leading to potential
losses.

### Root Cause


**Code Reference**:  
```solidity
function _placeOrder(...) private {
    if (!old.isEmpty() && old.maxFee.gt(order.maxFee)) 
        revert ManagerCannotReduceMaxFee(); // ❌ Only prevents reducing maxFee, not front-running
}
```

### Attack Path

**Scenario**:  
1. **User Action**: Alice places an order with `maxFee = 10 DSU`.  
2. **Keeper Sees Order**: Begins processing, expecting `10 DSU`.  
3. **User Front-Runs**: Updates order to `maxFee = 5 DSU`.  
4. **Result**: Keeper receives `5 DSU` but spent gas based on `10 DSU`.  

### Impact

- **Keeper Losses**: Keepers commit gas expecting a higher fee, but receive less after a user front-runs the transaction.  
- **Protocol Trust**: Users can exploit this to underpay keepers, damaging protocol credibility.  

### PoC

### Mitigation

- Enforce a minimum fee increase threshold (e.g., `newMaxFee ≥ oldMaxFee * 0.9`).  
- Implement a time-delay for fee reductions.
